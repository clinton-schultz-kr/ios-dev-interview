# iOS App Interview Project

This is the interview base project for the iOS App team.

### The Project

**Goal**: Build a Pokedex client that lists Pokemon by using [the Pokemon API](https://pokeapi.co/)

We will use two endpoints from the Pokemon API :
1. `pokemon`  to get a list of pokemon and their pokemon detail URLS (this one stored locally in 'pokemon.json')
2. `detailedPokemon`  to get the detail of each individual pokemon ('https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/{id}/')

### Guidelines
1. The **UI** should be **functional**, but it **does not have to be polished**; we are more interested that the app works, and your thought process.
2. We have provided the basic MVVM app architecture. **Feel free to use or *not* use the architecture provided** if you feel more comfortable with other architecture.
3. **Feel free to use the internet** to search for APIs, Stack Overflow, etc. We don't expect you to have every detail of every API memorized.
